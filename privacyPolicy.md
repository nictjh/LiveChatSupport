Privacy Policy — Zentra Bank (Mobile)

Effective: 14 Oct 2025

Overview
Zentra Bank (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a mobile banking app. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

Camera Usage
We request CAMERA permission to enable QR code scanning (e.g., PayNow). Camera frames are processed on-device solely to detect and decode QR codes. We do not store photos or videos, nor upload raw camera frames to our servers.

Data We Collect
• Account & profile data you provide when you use the app.
• Diagnostic events (e.g., crashes, performance).
• No camera images are collected or stored.

Data Sharing
We do not sell personal data. We may share minimal data with service providers to operate the app (e.g., cloud hosting), under contractual safeguards.

Security
We use encryption in transit, access controls, and other safeguards appropriate for banking data.

Your Choices
You can deny CAMERA permission; QR scanning features will be disabled. Other banking features remain available where possible.
