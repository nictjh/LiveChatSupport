# üí¨ Live Chat Support (PoC)

A minimal **single-agent live chat support system** built with **FastAPI WebSockets** (for the server and customer endpoint) and a **Python CLI agent** (for staff to respond).

This project demonstrates how banks or mobile apps could integrate a lightweight, persistent WebSocket-based support channel into their apps.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`main.py`**
  - FastAPI server exposing `/ws` for WebSocket connections.
  - Handles both roles: `customer` and `agent`.
  - Manages an in-memory **queue** (FIFO) of waiting customers.
  - Assigns customers to the single agent when available.
  - Handles message relay, conversation transcripts, and clean teardown.

- **`agent_cli.py`**
  - A terminal-based CLI client for the support agent.
  - Connects to the FastAPI server as role=`agent`.
  - Displays incoming customer messages in real-time.
  - Lets the agent type replies, end conversations, or quit.


- **React Native Customer Screen (optional)**

## üöÄ How to Start

This project ships with a **Docker Compose** setup that launches both the FastAPI server and the Agent CLI in separate containers.

### 1. Build and start services
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- `app` ‚Üí FastAPI WebSocket server.
- `chat-agent` ‚Üí Agent CLI container (runs interactively).

### 2. Attach to Agent CLI
```bash
docker attach chat-agent
```

- You will see `[cli] Connected as AGENT. Waiting for assignment...`
- Type messages when customers connect.

Controls:
- `Ctrl+C` ‚Üí stop the CLI.
- `Ctrl+P`‚Üí detach from container (keep it running in background).

### 3. Monitor server logs
In another terminal:
```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

- Shows FastAPI server logs, connections and conversation transcripts.

### 4. Shut everything down
```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```
